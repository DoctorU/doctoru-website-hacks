This is the [github.io site for Steve Hobdell](https://doctoru.github.io/), also known as &quot;doctoruseful&quot;. Steve Hobdell has been living under this pseudonym since he was nicknamed Steve Useful at his rowing club in 1998. Shortly thereafter, Steve was finally awarded his PhD, making the Doctor Useful nickname complete.  Nowadays, Steve reserves doctoruseful for his technical shenannigans. 

Steve can also be found developing his mountaineering career in the mountains of Snowdonia, posting to [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevehmountain), [facebook](https://facebook.com/stevehobdellmountainadventures) and [his website](https://www.mountainadventures.stevehobdell.com).

Site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
