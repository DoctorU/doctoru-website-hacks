I have been writing code since 2000.

My first job as a software engineer was in 2000.
My CV was written in HTML CSS and Javascript. I wrote it to work on Firefox. 
Sadly, the interviewer chose to view it in IE and it was completely broken!
Regardless of that little upset, it was enough to prove that, despite my background
(electronic and electrical engineering), I had the nous to write code.

My career in software development began there. 
I largely stopped writing code professionally around 2014, with moves toward
 management  roles: business strategy, process streamlining,
product management, and currently compliance. But it doesn't mean that I don't love
coding!

This website will act as an outlet to vent my coder's rage occasionally. 

If there's a useful tool that you're missing, let me know and I'll see about 
adding it in.
