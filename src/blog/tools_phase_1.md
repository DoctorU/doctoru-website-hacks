I've completed the first tranche of tools. 
There are converters and calculators. 

## Calculators

* Calculate compound interest
* Calculate a target temperature unit from a source one. _(Perhaps this should be in converters?)_

## Converters

Converters contain a couple of useful ones:

* Convert plain text into base64 encoded text and vice versa.
* Convert plain text into url encoded text and vice versa. Allows double-encoding/double-unencoding.
